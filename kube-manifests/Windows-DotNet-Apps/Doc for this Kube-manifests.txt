In this module, I have tried to include manifests having services types like Loadbalancer and Ingress through App_Gateway 
which can be used to exposed application pods outside the Kubernetes Cluster environment apart from the configuration
that I have used in the terraform-manifests files.

We can also use helm to deploy NGINX Ingress Controller on Kubernetes Cluster created above using steps mentioned in below URL.
