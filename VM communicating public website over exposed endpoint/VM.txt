In this module I have tried to create Bastion Host Windows VM that can be easily aaccessible by static public ip and also being 
exposed over an endpoint to a Azure Service like Blob storage for communicating with public website exposed by Azure Blob Storage.
We can also use Azure DNS service to assign FQDN(Domain Name) to this public website.
