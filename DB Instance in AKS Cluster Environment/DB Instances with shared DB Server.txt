In this module I have tried to create the DB Instances interacting with separate AKS cluster as per the terraform workspaces which 
would provide us different environments like staging and productiom with different resources groups properties.
I have created different aks cluster as I was having some doubt regarding current db instances allocation with respect to 
main application environment Infrastructure.
I could have also used statefullset in main application Kubernetes environment for these db instances but due to lack of 
knowledge about  crticality, storage persistance and environment configuration,I tried to avoid it as it is currently existing 
on an ICON shared environment.

-> Note 1 : We can use regional Azure Database Service like Azure PostgreSql database(Regional Service) or 
          for more high availability, we can use Azure for SQL database(Global Database).
          For more scalability and NoSQL functionality, we can go for Azure Cosmos Database.

-> Note 2 : We can also use Azure Site to Site VPN Connection over secured IPSec tunnels for more secure communication between 
databases in different or same datacentres/zones and networking componenents and services in aks cluster in Azure environment.

-> Note 3 : We can also use Azure Express Route for a more dedicated connnection between databases and azure services and components.
