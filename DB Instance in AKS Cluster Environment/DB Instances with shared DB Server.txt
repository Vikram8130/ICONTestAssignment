In this module I have tried to create the DB Instances interatcing with separate AKS cluster as per the terraform workspace which 
would provide us different environment like staging and productiom with different resources groups properties.I have created different 
aks cluster as I was having some doubt regarding current db instances allocation with respect yo main application environment 
Infrastructure.
I could have also used statefullset in main application Kubernetes environment for these db instances but due to lack of 
knowledge about  crticality, storage persistance and enironment configuration,, I tried to avoid it as it is currently existing 
on ICON shared environment.
