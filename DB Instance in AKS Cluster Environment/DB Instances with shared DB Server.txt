In this module I have tried to create the DB Instances interacting with separate AKS cluster as per the terraform workspaces which 
would provide us different environments like staging and productiom with different resources groups properties.
I have created different aks cluster as I was having some doubt regarding current db instances allocation with respect to 
main application environment Infrastructure.
I could have also used statefullset in main application Kubernetes environment for these db instances but due to lack of 
knowledge about  crticality, storage persistance and enironment configuration,I tried to avoid it as it is currently existing 
on an ICON shared environment.
